	//  the calculator enumerates through the scavengemap to calculate things, each entry it processes
	//  it sets back into the map. maybe it would be better expressed as a visitor.
	//  in any case the enumerator needs to cope with the collection values being updated in this
	//  restricted way as we iterate through.

	//qq apart from the in memory version, we'll probably want a couple of different persistent versions
	// too.
	//  - one that stores a large number of fixed size keys/values with random access
	//      (eg hashes are keys)
	//  - one that stores a small number of variable sized keys (e.g. for stream names)
	//  - one that stores a large number of items where the key is a hash and the value is a stream name
	//      may or may not be a separate implemention on the grounds that the values are variable size
