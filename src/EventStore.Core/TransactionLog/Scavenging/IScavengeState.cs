	//qq this summary comment will explain the general shape of the scavenge state - what it needs to be
	// able to store and retrieve and why.
	//
	// There are two kinds of streams that we might want to remove events from
	//    - original streams
	//        - according to tombstone
	//        - according to metadata (maxage, maxcount, tb)
	//    - metadata streams
	//        - according to tombstone
	//        - maxcount 1
	//
	// Together these are the scavengable streams. We store a DiscardPoint for each so that we can
	// 
	// We only need to store metadata for the user streams with metadata since the metadata for
	// metadatastreams is implicit.
	// 
	// however, we need to know about _all_ the stream collisions in the database not just the ones
	// that we might remove events from, so that later we can scavenge the index without looking anything
	// up in the log.


	// accumulator iterates through the log, spotting metadata records
	// put in the data that the chunk and ptable scavenging require
	public interface IScavengeStateForAccumulator<TStreamId> {
		// call this for each record as we accumulate through the log so that we can spot every hash
		// collision to save ourselves work later.
		//qq maybe prefer passing in a single arg (the record) and getting its streamid and position
		//qq mabe rename if we want the state to not be containing logic
		//qq maybe DetectCollisions

		// on tombstone, for which the previous value is not relevant.
